Article XX - Acceptance A contract is deemed accepted when a member signs a transaction which incorporates a TAPOS proof of a block whose implied state incoporates an ABI and associated Ricardian contracts and said transaction is incorporated into the blockchain. Article XX - Counterparts This Constitution may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall constitute a duplicate original, but all counterparts together shall constitute a single agreement.";
